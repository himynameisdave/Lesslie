###Lesslie [![](http://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/himynameisdave/Lesslie/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
> The Modular [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) Library For The Rest of Us!

We all need a good LESS library to simplify stupid things like vendor prefixes and just general annoyances we all face.

Meet Lesslie. She's the hot new young thing on the block. Totally modular, always being updated, and easy to understand and use.

Built out of little components that you can easily remove/steal/alter as you please, messing around with Lesslie makes LESS an even better choice as a pre-processor.
