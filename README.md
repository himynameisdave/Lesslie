We all need a good LESS library to simplify stupid things like vendor prefixes and just general annoyances we all face.

Meet Lesslie. She's the cool new young thang on the block. Totally modular, constantly being updated & maintained, and easy to understand and use.

Built out of little components that you can easily remove/steal/alter as you please, messing around with Lesslie is dead simple and is great for inspiration for your own Less library (because there is nothing better than DIY).

####Howcanigetit?

Clone this repo, or through the good ol' [Bowers](http://bower.io/):

```bash
bower install git@github.com:himynameisdave/less-core.git
```

By default, it's gunna throw that in your bower_components/ directory. You can use it as a reference when writing your Less like this:

```less
@import (reference) "[root directory]./bower_components/Lesslie/dist/lesslie.less";
```

#####Future

Looking to maybe expand Lesslie to be a (light) framework. In other words I'm essentially like every other front-end dev with too much time on his hands.
